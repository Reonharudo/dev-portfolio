            <p>Welcome on my page!</p>
            <p>
                I am a 23 year old Software Engineer with a relentless passion
                for learning and staying at the forefront of technology.

                I embrace the philosophy that FOMO(Fear of Missing Out) drives
                continuous improvement in our rapidly evolving field.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond my software engineering endeavours, I am a hardware
                enthusiast as you may see on the pictures on your right :)
                Additionally, I actively collect and peruse Wikipedia articles
                spanning topics from medical science to philosophical or
                history, maintaining them as valuable references.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
