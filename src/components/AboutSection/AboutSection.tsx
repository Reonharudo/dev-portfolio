                        ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a {age} year old Software Engineer with a
                        relentless passion for learning and staying staying

                    <p>
                        ðŸš€ I believe in the power of continuous improvement,
                        fueled by the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). This
                        philosophy has propelled me to explore cutting-edge
                        technologies and embrace new challenges, resulting in my
                        recent discovery of NextJS. A framework that saves me a
                        lot of time to build SEO and performance critical
                        Web-Apps.

                    <p>
                        ðŸ’» As a hardware enthusiast, I&apos;m currently gearing
                        up to build my next rig, eagerly anticipating the
                        performance boost from the upcoming Zen5 CPU and
                        3D-VCache. My goal? To elevate my computing experience
                        with a seamless upgrade to 32GB DDR5 RAM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ðŸ“š Beyond code, I immerse myself in diverse realms. My
                        collection of Wikipedia articles spans topics from
                        medical science to philosophy and history, serving as a
                        treasure trove of valuable references.
